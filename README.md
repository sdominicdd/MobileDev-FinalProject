## Overview
- This is the final project in the Mobile development course, Semester 5 - CPA 3.
- The goal is to build a React Navtive app using EXPO and React (JS).

## Usage
- Clone this Repository.
- cd into the folder that contains App.jsx and node_modules if not already in it.
- Install any react dependencies by doing `npm i` (this will automatically look for dependecies mentioned in the package.json file and install them.)
- Open up Android Studio, navigate to the Virtual Device Manager and start up an AVD (android virtual device).
  Alternatively you may install the Expo app on your physical android phone.
- Open a commmand prompt at the root folder, the folder that contains App.jsx.
- Type npx expo start . This will start the server, a barcode should display. Follow displayed instructions to run the app on your android phone (virtual or physical).
